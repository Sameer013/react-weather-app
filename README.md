# React Weather App

I created this project with React using OpenWeather API

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

It is my first time building Apps on React so I would appreciate any advice.\
Thank You.
